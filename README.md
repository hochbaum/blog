# Blog
This is a very simplistic blog made using Go.

## What's left?
- [ ] Some TODOs in the code
- [ ] SSL support
- [ ] Better responsive design (lol)
- [ ] Properly scaled image support

## What's the benefit of using your blog?
Literally nothing.

## How to use?
```
$ make
$ cd build
$ ./blog
```
